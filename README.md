# UGI-Corpus
The UGI Corpus is a multi-modal dataset of 22 group meetings where the participants perform a collaborative group task, collected using ceiling mounted, unobtrusive depth sensors and lapel microphones. The absence of frontal cameras and RGB information, and the anonymized time-stamped meeting transcripts make this an unobtrusive, identity-preserving multi-modal dataset that can be used to study task-based group interactions. 
The dataset contains:
-- Distance measurements from 2 ceiling mounted Microsoft Kinects.
-- Time-stamped anonymized meeting transcripts.
